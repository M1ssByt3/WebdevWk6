In this week's assignment we explore JavaScript Event Handling & Interactive Elements Assignment. 

Created a simple interactive landing page called Dog Haven - Dog Sale Landing Page
 It showcases dogs available for adoption! This project simulates a dog shelter’s online presence with essential features to engage users and promote dog adoptions.
    * Features
* Available & Adopted Dogs Tabs

    Switch between two sections: Available Dogs and Adopted.

    Allows users to see which dogs are currently adoptable.

* Adopt Button Interaction

    Each dog card has an "Adopt Me" button.

    On click, the button updates with a thank-you message and disables further interactions — simulating an adoption!

* Image Slider / Gallery

    A beautiful mini gallery that lets users browse through a selection of dog images.

    Click the ← and → buttons to scroll through the slider.

* Adoption Form with Validation

    Users can fill out a simple form with their Name, Email, and Password and are all required.

    Real-time feedback for password strength.

    Input validation ensures email format and password length are correct before submission.

* Interactive Easter Eggs

    On pressing the letter 'D' key it triggers a fun dog alert!

    Double-click anywhere on the page to activate a secret dog trick message.

* Technologies Used

    HTML5 – for the structure.

    CSS – for layout and responsive styling.

    JavaScript – for interactivity and dynamic behavior.
